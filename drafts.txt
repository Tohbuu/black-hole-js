AI-Enhanced Intrusion-Resistant Encryption for IoT Applications

Problem

IoT devices are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks such as replay, 
brute-force, and packet injection because they rely on static encryption methods 
that do not adapt to real-time threats. Traditional cryptographic algorithms are either 
too heavy for resource-constrained devices or fail to adjust once compromised, 
leaving systems exposed.


Description

This study proposes the development of an AI-enhanced encryption 
framework for IoT devices that combines machine learning‚Äìbased anomaly 
detection with dynamic encryption adjustment. The system will automatically 
modify its encryption parameters (e.g., key size, algorithm switching, or session renewal) 
when intrusion attempts are detected, thereby strengthening resistance against evolving 
threats while remaining lightweight enough for IoT hardware.


Objective

To design and implement an intrusion-resistant encryption system for IoT applications that:
Detects abnormal network behavior using machine learning.
Dynamically adapts encryption schemes in response to detected threats.
Improves the overall security of IoT communications without exceeding device resource limitations.

üü¢ ESP32 Development Boards (recommended) ‚Üí built-in Wi-Fi & decent processing power.
Alternative: STM32 Nucleo boards or Raspberry Pi Pico W (if you want more control).
Server/Coordinator Device:
Raspberry Pi 4 (as a local broker + anomaly detection runner) OR a laptop/desktop running the AI model.
Networking Components:
Wi-Fi Router or Access Point (to interconnect IoT nodes).
Optional: Ethernet cables + switch if you want wired testing.
Power Supply:
USB cables & adapters for ESP32 nodes.
Power bank (if mobile testing is needed).
Testing Equipment (Optional but useful):
Logic analyzer or Wireshark-compatible laptop ‚Üí for monitoring traffic & simulating attacks.

2. Software & Tools
Your system will be both IoT firmware + AI/Server-side processing.
IoT Firmware (Device-Side):
Arduino IDE / PlatformIO (for ESP32 firmware).
C/C++ (for lightweight encryption and MQTT communication).
Server-Side (AI + Encryption Manager):
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for anomaly detection ML model).
Scikit-learn (training/testing intrusion detection models).
